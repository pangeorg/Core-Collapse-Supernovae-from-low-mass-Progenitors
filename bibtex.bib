  abstract      = {Neutron stars (NSs) obtain kicks of typically several 100 km/s at birth. The gravitational tug-boat mechanism can explain these kicks as consequences of asymmetric mass ejection during the supernova (SN) explosion. Support for this hydrodynamic explanation is provided by observations of SN remnants with associated NSs, which confirm the prediction that the bulk of the explosion ejecta, in particular chemical elements between silicon and the iron group, are dominantly expelled in the hemisphere opposite to the direction of the NS kick. Here, we present a large set of two- and three-dimensional explosion simulations of electron-capture SNe, considering explosion energies between ~3x10^49 erg and ~1.6x10^50 erg. We find that the fast acceleration of the SN shock in the steep density gradient delimiting the O-Ne-Mg core of the progenitor enables such a rapid expansion of neutrino-heated matter that the growth of neutrino-driven convection freezes out quickly in a high-mode spherical harmonics pattern. Since the corresponding momentum asymmetry of the ejecta is very small and the gravitational acceleration by the fast-expanding ejecta abates rapidly, the NS kick velocities are at most a few km/s. The extremely low core compactness of O-Ne-Mg-core progenitors therefore favors hydrodynamic NS kicks much below the ~160 km/s measured for the Crab pulsar. This suggests either that the Crab Nebula is not the remnant of an electron-capture SN, but of a low-mass iron-core progenitor, or that the Crab pulsar was not accelerated by the gravitational tug-boat mechanism but received its kick by a non-hydrodynamic mechanism such as, e.g., anisotropic neutrino emission.},

  abstract      = {Thus far, judging the fate of a massive star (either a neutron star (NS) or a black hole) solely by its structure prior to core collapse has been ambiguous. Our work and previous attempts find a non-monotonic variation of successful and failed supernovae with zero-age main-sequence mass, for which no single structural parameter can serve as a good predictive measure. However, we identify two parameters computed from the pre-collapse structure of the progenitor, which in combination allow for a clear separation of exploding and non-exploding cases with only few exceptions (~1-2.5%) in our set of 621 investigated stellar models. One parameter is M4, defining the normalized enclosed mass for a dimensionless entropy per nucleon of s=4, and the other is mu4 = d(m/M_sun)/d(r/1000 km) at s=4, being the normalized mass-derivative at this location. The two parameters mu4 and M4*mu4 can be directly linked to the mass-infall rate, Mdot, of the collapsing star and the electron-type neutrino luminosity of the accreting proto-NS, L_nue ~ M_ns*Mdot, which play a crucial role in the "critical luminosity" concept for the theoretical description of neutrino-driven explosions as runaway phenomenon of the stalled accretion shock. All models were evolved employing the approach of Ugliano et al. for simulating neutrino-driven explosions in spherical symmetry. The neutrino emission of the accretion layer is approximated by a gray transport solver, while the uncertain neutrino emission of the 1.1 M_sun proto-NS core is parametrized by an analytic model. The free parameters connected to the core-boundary prescription are calibrated to reproduce the observables of Supernova 1987A for five different progenitor models.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the behavior and consequences of the reverse shock that terminates the supersonic expansion of the baryonic wind which is driven by neutrino heating off the surface of (non-magnetized) new-born neutron stars in supernova cores. To this end we perform long-time hydrodynamic simulations in spherical symmetry. In agreement with previous relativistic wind studies, we find that the neutrino-driven outflow accelerates to supersonic velocities and in case of a compact, about 1.4 solar mass (gravitational mass) neutron star with a radius of about 10 km, the wind reaches entropies of about 100 k_B per nucleon. The wind, however, is strongly influenced by the environment of the supernova core. It is decelerated and shock-heated abruptly by a termination shock that forms when the supersonic outflow collides with the slower preceding supernova ejecta. The radial position of this reverse shock varies with time and depends on the strength of the neutrino wind and the different conditions in progenitor stars with different masses and structure. Its basic properties and behavior can be understood by simple analytic considerations. We demonstrate that the entropy of matter going through the reverse shock can increase to a multiple of the asymptotic wind value. Seconds after the onset of the explosion it therefore can exceed 400 k_B per nucleon. The temperature of the shocked wind has typically dropped to about or less than 10^9 K, and density and temperature in the shock-decelerated matter continue to decrease only very slowly. Such conditions might strongly affect the important phases of supernova nucleosynthesis in a time and progenitor dependent way. (abridged)},

Although we were initially inspired by and agree in detail with the mechanism for initiating gravitational instability proposed by Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler, and Hoyle, we find that the dynamical implosion is so violent that an energy many times greater than the available thermonuclear energy is released from the star's core and transferred to the star's mantle in a supernova explosion. The energy released corresponds to the change in gravitational potential of the unstable imploding core; the transfer of energy takes place by the emission and deposition of neutrinos.},

  abstract      = {We present multidimensional simulations of the post-explosion hydrodynamics in three different 15 M $_{sun}$ supernova models with zero, 10$^{-4}$ Z $_{sun}$, and Z $_{sun}$ metallicities. We follow the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability that mixes together the stellar layers in the wake of the explosion. Models are initialized with spherically symmetric explosions and perturbations are seeded by the grid. Calculations are performed in two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric and three-dimensional (3D) Cartesian coordinates using the new Eulerian hydrodynamics code, CASTRO. We find as in previous work that RT perturbations initially grow faster in 3D than in 2D. As the RT fingers interact with one another, mixing proceeds to a greater degree in 3D than in 2D, reducing the local Atwood number and slowing the growth rate of the instability in 3D relative to 2D. By the time mixing has stopped, the width of the mixed region is similar in the 2D and 3D simulations provided the RT fingers show significant interaction. Our results imply that 2D simulations of light curves and nucleosynthesis in supernovae that die as red giants may capture the features of an initially spherically symmetric explosion in far less computational time than required by a full 3D simulation. However, capturing large departures from spherical symmetry requires a significantly perturbed explosion. Large-scale asymmetries cannot develop through an inverse cascade of merging RT structures; they must arise from asymmetries in the initial explosion.},

  abstract  = {Neutrino transport and neutrino interactions in dense matter play a crucial role in stellar core collapse, supernova explosions and neutron star formation. Here we present a detailed description of a new numerical code for treating the time and energy dependent neutrino transport in hydrodynamical simulations of such events. The code is based on a variable Eddington factor method to deal with the integro-differential character of the Boltzmann equation. The moments of the neutrino distribution function and the energy and lepton number exchange with the stellar medium are determined by iteratively solving the zeroth and first order moment equations in combination with a model Boltzmann equation. The latter is discretized on a grid of tangent rays. The integration of the transport equations and the neutrino source terms is performed in a time-implicit way. In the present version of the program, the transport part is coupled to an explicit hydrodynamics code which follows the evolution of the stellar plasma by a finite-volume method with piecewise parabolic interpolation, using a Riemann solver to calculate the hydrodynamic states. The neutrino source terms are implemented in an operator-split step. Neutrino transport and hydrodynamics can be calculated with different spatial grids and different time steps. The structure of the described code is modular and offers a high degree of flexibility for an application to relativistic and multi-dimensional problems at different levels of refinement and accuracy. We critically evaluate results for a number of test cases, including neutrino transport in rapidly moving stellar media and approximate relativistic core collapse, and suggest a path for generalizing the code to be used in multi-dimensional simulations of convection in neutron stars and supernovae.

  abstract = {Simple modifications for higher-order Godunov-type difference schemes are presented which allow for accurate advection of multi-fluid flows in hydrodynamic simulations. The constraint that the sum of all mass fractions has to be equal to one in every computational zone throughout the simulation is fulfilled by renormalizing the mass fractions during the advection step. The proposed modification is appropriate for any difference scheme written in conservation form. Unlike other commonly used methods it does not violate the conservative character of the advection method. A new steepening mechanism, which is based on modification of interpolation profiles, is used to reduce numerical diffusion across composition discontinuities. Additional procedures are described, which are necessary to enforce monotonicity. Several numerical experiments are presented which demonstrate the capability of our Consistent Multi-fluid Advection (CMA) method in case of smooth and discontinuous distributions of fluid phases and under different hydrodynamic conditions. It is shown that due to the reduced diffusivity of the proposed scheme the abundance of some heavy elements obtained from hydrodynamic simulations of type II supernova explosions can change by a factor of a few in the most extreme cases.},

Two additional parameters include an average neutrino escape energy and a neutrino trapping density. The parameterized simulations reproduce the consequences of the delicate neutrino thermalization-diffusion process during the collapse phase and provide a by far more realistic alternative to the adiabatic approximation, which has often been used in the investigation of the emission of gravitational waves, of multidimensional general relativistic effects, of the evolution of magnetic fields, or even of the nucleosynthesis in simulations of core collapse and bounce. For supernova codes that are specifically designed for the postbounce phase, the parameterization builds a convenient bridge between the point where the applicability of a stellar evolution code ends and the point where the postbounce evolution begins.},

  abstract = {The role of neutrino heating and convective processes in the explosion mechanism of Type-II supernovae is investigated by one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the long-time evolution of the collapsed stellar core after the bounce at nuclear matter density and after the associated formation of the supernova shock. The parameters describing the neutrino emission from the collapsed stellar core are systematically varied. The possibility to obtain explosions turns out to be very sensitive to the physical conditions in and at the protoneutron star, in particular to its contraction and to the neutrino cooling inside of the gain radius. Yet, above a certain threshold for the core neutrino luminosity, stable and energetic explosions can be obtained in spherical symmetry, provided the energy deposition by neutrinos remains strong for a sufficiently long period. The explosion energy and time scale critically depend on the neutrino fluxes during the shock revival phase and on their temporal decay during the first few 100ms after shock formation. The threshold luminosity is a very sensitive function of the shock stagnation radius, because small radii of the stalled prompt shock lead to significantly higher neutrino loss from the hot and compact postshock layers, cause the region of neutrino heating to be very narrow, and reduce the heating time scale of the matter due to the high infall velocity. Repeating the simulations in two dimensions we find that strong convective processes occur in the collapsed stellar core in two spatially separate regions. One region of convection lies inside the neutrinosphere and another one is located in the neutrino-heated layer below the shock front. The convective mixing around the neutrinosphere is mainly driven by the negative lepton gradient, which is maintained by rapid loss of leptons from the semitransparent layers at the neutrinosphere. This considerably speeds up the deleptonization of the outer layers of the collapsed stellar core. Even 0.5 seconds after bounce a quasi-stationary pattern of convective motion is still present in the protoneutron star. Three-dimensional simulations reveal that rising and sinking convective elements have about half the size as in two dimensions with angular diameters between 10deg and 15deg, which causes corresponding anisotropies of the neutrino emission from the core. The large-scale convective overturn that takes place between the shock and the position of maximum neutrino heating is able to efficiently transport energy from the heated layer into the postshock region. This helps to stabilize the shock revival during the critical phase. It also leads to a faster increase and earlier saturation of the explosion energy, both because neutrino-heated material quickly moves out of the heating region and energy loss by the re-emission of neutrinos is reduced. The overturn pattern shows downflows of matter in narrow flux tubes and rising bubbles with typical angular extensions of 30deg to 60deg (in two dimensions). The material falling towards the neutron star loses lepton number, but readily absorbs energy in the neutrino-heated region, before it rises again. When the explosion gains momentum, this matter is not accreted onto the cooler, neutron-rich protoneutron star any more. After about 200-300ms the convective shell gets decoupled from the heating region and starts to move away from the neutron star to expand in an essentially self-similar way as a thick layer behind the outward propagating shock. The nearly spherically symmetrical ``hot-bubble'' region begins to develop and turbulence around the protoneutron star ceases. When the supernova shock passes the entropy step of the Si-O-interface about 400-500ms after bounce, the density inversion between the low-density hot-bubble region and the inhomogeneous shell steepens into a strong reverse shock that forms a sharp discontinuity in the neutrino wind from the nascent neutron star. The supernova shock is significantly deformed and velocity, density, temperature, and entropy in the postshock region exhibit large-scale variations with a contrast of up to a factor of 3. This must have consequences for the formation and spatial distribution of nucleosynthesis products and might help to explain the clumpiness, anisotropies, envelope and mantle mixing, and large velocities of iron group nuclei which were observed in the ejecta of SN 1987A and other supernovae. Although in this respect of essential importance, convection in the postshock region does not seem to be indispensable to get successful Type-II explosions via the neutrino-heating mechanism, nor do our simulations allow for the conclusion that its presence inevitably makes the mechanism successful and the explosions very energetic. As in spherical symmetry, the explosion energy and time scale are influenced by the contraction of the cooling neutron star and are very sensitive to the neutrino energy deposition and the size of the neutrino fluxes during a period of several hundred milliseconds after core bounce.},

  abstract      = {A large fraction of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), 30-50 per cent, are expected to originate from the low-mass end of progenitors with M$_{ZAMS}$ = 8-12 M$_{⊙}$. However, degeneracy effects make stellar evolution modelling of such stars challenging, and few predictions for their supernova light curves and spectra have been presented. Here, we calculate synthetic nebular spectra of a 9 M$_{⊙}$ Fe CCSN model exploded with the neutrino mechanism. The model predicts emission lines with FWHM {\tilde} 1000 km s$^{-1}$, including signatures from each deep layer in the metal core. We compare this model to the observations of the three subluminous IIP SNe with published nebular spectra; SN 1997D, SN 2005cs and SN 2008bk. The predictions of both line profiles and luminosities are in good agreement with SN 1997D and SN 2008bk. The close fit of a model with no tuning parameters provides strong evidence for an association of these objects with low-mass Fe CCSNe. For SN 2005cs, the interpretation is less clear, as the observational coverage ended before key diagnostic lines from the core had emerged. We perform a parametrized study of the amount of explosively made stable nickel, and find that none of these three SNe show the high $^{58}$Ni/$^{56}$Ni ratio predicted by current models of electron capture SNe (ECSNe) and ECSN-like explosions. Combined with clear detection of lines from O and He shell material, these SNe rather originate from Fe core progenitors. We argue that the outcome of self-consistent explosion simulations of low-mass stars, which gives fits to many key observables, strongly suggests that the class of subluminous Type IIP SNe is the observational counterpart of the lowest mass CCSNe.},

  abstract     = {Massive star supernovae can be divided into four categories, depending on the amount of mass loss from the progenitor star and the star's radius: red supergiant stars with most of the H envelope intact (SN IIP), stars with some H but most lost (IIL and IIb), stars with all H lost (Ib and Ic), and blue supergiant stars with a massive H envelope (SN 1987A-like). Various aspects of the immediate aftermath of the supernova are expected to develop in different ways, depending on the supernova category: mixing in the supernova, fallback on the central compact object, expansion of any pulsar wind nebula, interaction with circumstellar matter, and photoionization by shock breakout radiation. The observed properties of young supernova remnants allow many of them to be placed in one of the supernova categories; all the categories are represented except for the SN 1987A-like type. Of the remnants with central pulsars, the pulsar properties do not appear to be related to the supernova category. There is no evidence that the supernova categories form a mass sequence, as would be expected in a single-star scenario for the evolution. Models for young pulsar wind nebulae expanding into supernova ejecta indicate initial pulsar periods of 10-100 ms and approximate equipartition between particle and magnetic energies. Ages are obtained for pulsar nebulae, including an age of 2400+/-500 yr for 3C 58, which is not consistent with an origin in SN 1181. There is no evidence that mass fallback plays a role in neutron star properties.},

  abstract = {The onset of instabilities during the first phases of supernova explosions, when the material is still optically thick and radiation dominated, is studied theoretically. Convection appears to be much more effective than the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which has been considered in the past. A class of self-similar analytical solutions is used for the explosion in a medium with a power law density distribution to evaluate the effectiveness of convection. It is found, for a slope of the original density profile close to -3, that convection not only saturates, but also noticeably affects the dynamics of the explosion. A slope close to -3 is in fact in general agreement with models of high mass, radiation dominated stars, which are commonly accepted as Type II supernova progenitors.},

  abstract      = {Recent studies have claimed the existence of very massive stars (VMS) up to 300 M $_{⊙}$ in the local Universe. As this finding may represent a paradigm shift for the canonical stellar upper-mass limit of 150 M $_{⊙}$, it is timely to discuss the status of the data, as well as the far-reaching implications of such objects. We held a Joint Discussion at the General Assembly in Beijing to discuss (i) the determination of the current masses of the most massive stars, (ii) the formation of VMS, (iii) their mass loss, and (iv) their evolution and final fate. The prime aim was to reach broad consensus between observers and theorists on how to identify and quantify the dominant physical processes.},

  abstract      = {The theory underlying the evolution and death of stars heavier than 10 M$_{⊙}$ on the main sequence is reviewed with an emphasis upon stars much heavier than 30 M$_{⊙}$. These are stars that, in the absence of substantial mass loss, are expected to either produce black holes when they die, or, for helium cores heavier than about 35 M$_{⊙}$, encounter the pair instability. A wide variety of outcomes is possible depending upon the initial composition of the star, its rotation rate, and the physics used to model its evolution. These stars can produce some of the brightest supernovae in the universe, but also some of the faintest. They can make gamma-ray bursts or collapse without a whimper. Their nucleosynthesis can range from just CNO to a broad range of elements up to the iron group. Though rare nowadays, they probably played a disproportionate role in shaping the evolution of the universe following the formation of its first stars.},

  abstract      = {Fallback in core-collapse supernovae is considered a major ingredient for explaining abundance anomalies in metal-poor stars and the natal kicks and spins of black holes (BHs). We present a first 3D simulation of BH formation and fallback in an {\ldquo}aborted{\rdquo} neutrino-driven explosion of a 40 solar mass zero-metallicity progenitor from collapse to shock breakout. We follow the phase up to BH formation using the relativistic COCONUT-FMT code. For the subsequent evolution to shock breakout we apply the moving-mesh code AREPO to core-collapse supernovae for the first time. Our simulation shows that despite early BH formation, neutrino-heated bubbles can survive for tens of seconds before being accreted, leaving them sufficient time to transfer part of their energy to sustain the shock wave as is propagates through the envelope. Although the initial net energy ({\tilde}2 Bethe) of the neutrino-heated ejecta barely equals the binding energy of the envelope, 11 $\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$ of hydrogen are still expelled with an energy of 0.23 Bethe. We find no significant mixing and only a modest BH kick and spin, but speculate that stronger effects could occur for slightly more energetic explosions or progenitors with less tightly bound envelopes.},

  abstract      = {We study the final fate of a very massive star by performing full general relativistic (GR), three-dimensional (3D) simulation with three-flavour multi-energy neutrino transport. Utilizing a 70 solar mass zero-metallicity progenitor, we self-consistently follow the radiation-hydrodynamics from the onset of gravitational core-collapse until the second collapse of the proto-neutron star (PNS), leading to black hole (BH) formation. Our results show that the BH formation occurs at a post-bounce time of T$_{pb}$ {\tilde} 300 ms for the 70 M$_{⊙}$ star. This is significantly earlier than those in the literature where lower mass progenitors were employed. At a few {\tilde}10 ms before BH formation, we find that the stalled bounce shock is revived by intense neutrino heating from the very hot PNS, which is aided by violent convection behind the shock. In the context of 3D-GR core-collapse modelling with multi-energy neutrino transport, our numerical results present the first evidence to validate a fallback BH formation scenario of the 70 M$_{⊙}$ star.},

  abstract      = {We analyze the linear stability of a stalled accretion shock in a perfect gas with a parametrized cooling function L ~ rho^{beta-alpha} P^alpha. The instability is dominated by the l=1 mode if the shock radius exceeds 2-3 times the accretor radius, depending on the parameters of the cooling function. The growth rate and oscillation period are comparable to those observed in the numerical simulations of Blondin \& Mezzacappa (2006). The instability mechanism is analyzed by separately measuring the efficiencies of the purely acoustic cycle and the advective-acoustic cycle. These efficiencies are estimated directly from the eigenspectrum, and also through a WKB analysis in the high frequency limit. Both methods prove that the advective-acoustic cycle is unstable, and that the purely acoustic cycle is stable. Extrapolating these results to low frequency leads us to interpret the dominant mode as an advective-acoustic instability, different from the purely acoustic interpretation of Blondin \& Mezzacappa (2006). A simplified characterization of the instability is proposed, based on an advective-acoustic cycle between the shock and the radius r_nabla where the velocity gradients of the stationary flow are strongest. The importance of the coupling region in this mechanism calls for a better understanding of the conditions for an efficient advective-acoustic coupling in a decelerated, nonadiabatic flow, in order to extend these results to core-collapse supernovae.},
