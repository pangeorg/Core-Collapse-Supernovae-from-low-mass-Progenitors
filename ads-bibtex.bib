  abstract = {Ve regard the release of gravitational energy attending a dynamic change in configuration to be the primary energy source in supernovae explosions. Although we were initially inspired by and agree in detail with the mechanism for initiating gravitational instability proposed by Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler, and Hoyle, we find that the dynamical implosion is so violent that an energy many times greater than the available thermonuclear energy is released from the star's core and transferred to the star's mantle in a supernova explosion. The energy released corresponds to the change in gravitational potential of the unstable imploding core; the transfer of energy takes place by the emission and deposition of neutrinos.},

  abstract      = {We present multidimensional simulations of the post-explosion hydrodynamics in three different 15 M $_{sun}$ supernova models with zero, 10$^{-4}$ Z $_{sun}$, and Z $_{sun}$ metallicities. We follow the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability that mixes together the stellar layers in the wake of the explosion. Models are initialized with spherically symmetric explosions and perturbations are seeded by the grid. Calculations are performed in two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric and three-dimensional (3D) Cartesian coordinates using the new Eulerian hydrodynamics code, CASTRO. We find as in previous work that RT perturbations initially grow faster in 3D than in 2D. As the RT fingers interact with one another, mixing proceeds to a greater degree in 3D than in 2D, reducing the local Atwood number and slowing the growth rate of the instability in 3D relative to 2D. By the time mixing has stopped, the width of the mixed region is similar in the 2D and 3D simulations provided the RT fingers show significant interaction. Our results imply that 2D simulations of light curves and nucleosynthesis in supernovae that die as red giants may capture the features of an initially spherically symmetric explosion in far less computational time than required by a full 3D simulation. However, capturing large departures from spherical symmetry requires a significantly perturbed explosion. Large-scale asymmetries cannot develop through an inverse cascade of merging RT structures; they must arise from asymmetries in the initial explosion.},

  abstract = {Neutrino transport and neutrino interactions in dense matter play a crucial role in stellar core collapse, supernova explosions and neutron star formation. Here we present a detailed description of a new numerical code for treating the time and energy dependent neutrino transport in hydrodynamical simulations of such events. The code is based on a variable Eddington factor method to deal with the integro-differential character of the Boltzmann equation. The moments of the neutrino distribution function and the energy and lepton number exchange with the stellar medium are determined by iteratively solving the zeroth and first order moment equations in combination with a model Boltzmann equation. The latter is discretized on a grid of tangent rays. The integration of the transport equations and the neutrino source terms is performed in a time-implicit way. In the present version of the program, the transport part is coupled to an explicit hydrodynamics code which follows the evolution of the stellar plasma by a finite-volume method with piecewise parabolic interpolation, using a Riemann solver to calculate the hydrodynamic states. The neutrino source terms are implemented in an operator-split step. Neutrino transport and hydrodynamics can be calculated with different spatial grids and different time steps. The structure of the described code is modular and offers a high degree of flexibility for an application to relativistic and multi-dimensional problems at different levels of refinement and accuracy. We critically evaluate results for a number of test cases, including neutrino transport in rapidly moving stellar media and approximate relativistic core collapse, and suggest a path for generalizing the code to be used in multi-dimensional simulations of convection in neutron stars and supernovae. Appendices A and B and all their figures are only available at http://www.edpsciences.org},

Heger (2016, private communication); and the 9, 10, and 11 $\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$ (zero-age main-sequence) progenitors from Sukhbold et al. We confirm that the ECSN and ESCN-like progenitors explode easily even in 1D with explosion energies of up to a 0.15 Bethes (1 $\{$$\{$B$\}$$\}$$\backslash$equiv $\{$10$\}$$^{51}$ $\{$erg$\}$), and are a viable mechanism for the production of very-low-mass neutron stars. However, the 9, 10, and 11 $\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }$ progenitors do not explode in 1D and are not even necessarily easier to explode than higher-mass progenitor stars in 2D. We study the effect of perturbations and of changes to the microphysics and we find that relatively small changes can result in qualitatively different outcomes, even in 1D, for models sufficiently close to the explosion threshold. Finally, we revisit the impact of convection below the protoneutron star (PNS) surface. We analyze 1D and 2D evolutions of PNSs subject to the same boundary conditions. We find that the impact of PNS convection has been underestimated in previous studies and could result in an increase of the neutrino luminosity by up to factors of two.},

  abstract = {Simple modifications for higher-order Godunov-type difference schemes are presented which allow for accurate advection of multi-fluid flows in hydrodynamic simulations. The constraint that the sum of all mass fractions has to be equal to one in every computational zone throughout the simulation is fulfilled by renormalizing the mass fractions during the advection step. The proposed modification is appropriate for any difference scheme written in conservation form. Unlike other commonly used methods it does not violate the conservative character of the advection method. A new steepening mechanism, which is based on modification of interpolation profiles, is used to reduce numerical diffusion across composition discontinuities. Additional procedures are described, which are necessary to enforce monotonicity. Several numerical experiments are presented which demonstrate the capability of our Consistent Multi-fluid Advection (CMA) method in case of smooth and discontinuous distributions of fluid phases and under different hydrodynamic conditions. It is shown that due to the reduced diffusivity of the proposed scheme the abundance of some heavy elements obtained from hydrodynamic simulations of type II supernova explosions can change by a factor of a few in the most extreme cases.},

The parameterization of the neutrino physics is based on a bounce profile of the electron fraction as it results from state-of-the-art collapse simulations with multigroup Boltzmann neutrino transport in spherical symmetry. Two additional parameters include an average neutrino escape energy and a neutrino trapping density. The parameterized simulations reproduce the consequences of the delicate neutrino thermalization-diffusion process during the collapse phase and provide a by far more realistic alternative to the adiabatic approximation, which has often been used in the investigation of the emission of gravitational waves, of multidimensional general relativistic effects, of the evolution of magnetic fields, or even of the nucleosynthesis in simulations of core collapse and bounce. For supernova codes that are specifically designed for the postbounce phase, the parameterization builds a convenient bridge between the point where the applicability of a stellar evolution code ends and the point where the postbounce evolution begins.},

  abstract = {The role of neutrino heating and convective processes in the explosion mechanism of Type-II supernovae is investigated by one- and two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the long-time evolution of the collapsed stellar core after the bounce at nuclear matter density and after the associated formation of the supernova shock. The parameters describing the neutrino emission from the collapsed stellar core are systematically varied. The possibility to obtain explosions turns out to be very sensitive to the physical conditions in and at the protoneutron star, in particular to its contraction and to the neutrino cooling inside of the gain radius. Yet, above a certain threshold for the core neutrino luminosity, stable and energetic explosions can be obtained in spherical symmetry, provided the energy deposition by neutrinos remains strong for a sufficiently long period. The explosion energy and time scale critically depend on the neutrino fluxes during the shock revival phase and on their temporal decay during the first few 100ms after shock formation. The threshold luminosity is a very sensitive function of the shock stagnation radius, because small radii of the stalled prompt shock lead to significantly higher neutrino loss from the hot and compact postshock layers, cause the region of neutrino heating to be very narrow, and reduce the heating time scale of the matter due to the high infall velocity. Repeating the simulations in two dimensions we find that strong convective processes occur in the collapsed stellar core in two spatially separate regions. One region of convection lies inside the neutrinosphere and another one is located in the neutrino-heated layer below the shock front. The convective mixing around the neutrinosphere is mainly driven by the negative lepton gradient, which is maintained by rapid loss of leptons from the semitransparent layers at the neutrinosphere. This considerably speeds up the deleptonization of the outer layers of the collapsed stellar core. Even 0.5 seconds after bounce a quasi-stationary pattern of convective motion is still present in the protoneutron star. Three-dimensional simulations reveal that rising and sinking convective elements have about half the size as in two dimensions with angular diameters between 10deg and 15deg, which causes corresponding anisotropies of the neutrino emission from the core. The large-scale convective overturn that takes place between the shock and the position of maximum neutrino heating is able to efficiently transport energy from the heated layer into the postshock region. This helps to stabilize the shock revival during the critical phase. It also leads to a faster increase and earlier saturation of the explosion energy, both because neutrino-heated material quickly moves out of the heating region and energy loss by the re-emission of neutrinos is reduced. The overturn pattern shows downflows of matter in narrow flux tubes and rising bubbles with typical angular extensions of 30deg to 60deg (in two dimensions). The material falling towards the neutron star loses lepton number, but readily absorbs energy in the neutrino-heated region, before it rises again. When the explosion gains momentum, this matter is not accreted onto the cooler, neutron-rich protoneutron star any more. After about 200-300ms the convective shell gets decoupled from the heating region and starts to move away from the neutron star to expand in an essentially self-similar way as a thick layer behind the outward propagating shock. The nearly spherically symmetrical ``hot-bubble'' region begins to develop and turbulence around the protoneutron star ceases. When the supernova shock passes the entropy step of the Si-O-interface about 400-500ms after bounce, the density inversion between the low-density hot-bubble region and the inhomogeneous shell steepens into a strong reverse shock that forms a sharp discontinuity in the neutrino wind from the nascent neutron star. The supernova shock is significantly deformed and velocity, density, temperature, and entropy in the postshock region exhibit large-scale variations with a contrast of up to a factor of 3. This must have consequences for the formation and spatial distribution of nucleosynthesis products and might help to explain the clumpiness, anisotropies, envelope and mantle mixing, and large velocities of iron group nuclei which were observed in the ejecta of SN 1987A and other supernovae. Although in this respect of essential importance, convection in the postshock region does not seem to be indispensable to get successful Type-II explosions via the neutrino-heating mechanism, nor do our simulations allow for the conclusion that its presence inevitably makes the mechanism successful and the explosions very energetic. As in spherical symmetry, the explosion energy and time scale are influenced by the contraction of the cooling neutron star and are very sensitive to the neutrino energy deposition and the size of the neutrino fluxes during a period of several hundred milliseconds after core bounce.},

  abstract      = {A large fraction of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), 30-50 per cent, are expected to originate from the low-mass end of progenitors with M$_{ZAMS}$ = 8-12 M$_{⊙}$. However, degeneracy effects make stellar evolution modelling of such stars challenging, and few predictions for their supernova light curves and spectra have been presented. Here, we calculate synthetic nebular spectra of a 9 M$_{⊙}$ Fe CCSN model exploded with the neutrino mechanism. The model predicts emission lines with FWHM {\tilde} 1000 km s$^{-1}$, including signatures from each deep layer in the metal core. We compare this model to the observations of the three subluminous IIP SNe with published nebular spectra; SN 1997D, SN 2005cs and SN 2008bk. The predictions of both line profiles and luminosities are in good agreement with SN 1997D and SN 2008bk. The close fit of a model with no tuning parameters provides strong evidence for an association of these objects with low-mass Fe CCSNe. For SN 2005cs, the interpretation is less clear, as the observational coverage ended before key diagnostic lines from the core had emerged. We perform a parametrized study of the amount of explosively made stable nickel, and find that none of these three SNe show the high $^{58}$Ni/$^{56}$Ni ratio predicted by current models of electron capture SNe (ECSNe) and ECSN-like explosions. Combined with clear detection of lines from O and He shell material, these SNe rather originate from Fe core progenitors. We argue that the outcome of self-consistent explosion simulations of low-mass stars, which gives fits to many key observables, strongly suggests that the class of subluminous Type IIP SNe is the observational counterpart of the lowest mass CCSNe.},

  abstract      = {Massive star supernovae can be divided into four categories, depending on the amount of mass loss from the progenitor star and the star's radius: red supergiant stars with most of the H envelope intact (SN IIP), stars with some H but most lost (IIL and IIb), stars with all H lost (Ib and Ic), and blue supergiant stars with a massive H envelope (SN 1987A-like). Various aspects of the immediate aftermath of the supernova are expected to develop in different ways, depending on the supernova category: mixing in the supernova, fallback on the central compact object, expansion of any pulsar wind nebula, interaction with circumstellar matter, and photoionization by shock breakout radiation. The observed properties of young supernova remnants allow many of them to be placed in one of the supernova categories; all the categories are represented except for the SN 1987A-like type. Of the remnants with central pulsars, the pulsar properties do not appear to be related to the supernova category. There is no evidence that the supernova categories form a mass sequence, as would be expected in a single-star scenario for the evolution. Models for young pulsar wind nebulae expanding into supernova ejecta indicate initial pulsar periods of 10-100 ms and approximate equipartition between particle and magnetic energies. Ages are obtained for pulsar nebulae, including an age of 2400+/-500 yr for 3C 58, which is not consistent with an origin in SN 1181. There is no evidence that mass fallback plays a role in neutron star properties.},
